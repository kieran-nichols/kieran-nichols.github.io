Exciting Announcement!
I'm thrilled to share that I've started a new role at https://www.subzero-wolf.com/ as an Embedded Quality Assurance Engineer (Software Test Engineer). 
I'm eager to broaden my skills and contribute to the QA/Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) team. Together, we'll be developing automated testing systems for 
Sub-Zero's next-generation kitchen appliances.</br> 
I'm grateful to work for a company that places such a high value on quality, and one that deeply cares 
about both its employees and customers. Looking forward to this new chapter!
