*More details to come*
### Two Axis Adaptable Ankle (TADA)
Prosthetic ankle that modulates 2D ankle angle using brushless DC motors with motion and load sensors
* Overview of software architecture
* Designed the real-time controller of the TADA using the Robotic Operating System (ROS) on a Raspberry Pi 4
* Motors (C/C++)
* Motion/load sensors for prosthesis (Python)
* Motion sensor suit (C++)
* Graphical user interface (Python/HTML) 
* Distributed among Linux, Windows, and mobile systems
* Sample graphs for data analyses: [line](https://www.kieran-nichols.com/sample-line-plot-for-tada-data.html), [polar](https://www.kieran-nichols.com/sample-polar-plot-for-tada-data.html), [code](https://github.com/kieran-nichols/catkin_ws_remote/blob/main/data/for_bags/bag_proccessing_kn.py)
### Variable Stiffness Foot (VSF)
Prosthetic foot that modulates foot stiffness
* [Journal Manuscript](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1gTp74-6-e4tq)
* [Project Description](https://www.kieran-nichols.com/vsf_publication_post)
* Collaboration papers with University of Oregon for simulation analyses using VSF: papers one, two, three
## Neuromuscular Coordination Biomechanics Lab (UWNCL)
