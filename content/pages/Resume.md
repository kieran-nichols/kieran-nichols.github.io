## WORK EXPERIENCE
### Research Assistant, Madison, WI
#### Biomechatronics, Assistive Devices, Gait Engineering, and Rehabilitation Laboratory, Jan 2017 - Present
#####*Two Axis aDaptable Ankle (TADA): prosthetic ankle that modulates 2D ankle angle*
* Built the software architecture and evaluated the real-time controller of the TADA using the Robotic Operating System with various C/C++ and Python programs
* The TADA utilized programs for the motors (C/C++), motion/load sensors (Python), and a graphical user interface (Dash/Plotly)
* Optimized the raspberry pi to reduce latencies (real-time patch), use dedicated CPU cores, and have prioritized/locked threads for motor communication using CANopen on EtherCAT
* Led an interdisciplinary group of undergraduate and graduate students in mechanical design, electronic setup, embedded software and sensor-integration development, and data collection 		       
and analysis (journal manuscripts in progress)
#####_Variable Stiffness Foot (VSF): prosthetic foot that modulates foot stiffness_
* Validated the embedded software (C program), which used inertial sensors, motors, and a potentiometer for experiments on persons with lower-leg amputations
* Processed and evaluated 3D marker and force plate data to access the effect of foot stiffness on the lower-limb knee and ankle mechanics (journal manuscripts: one, two, three, four: accepted)
#### Neuromuscular Coordination Biomechanics Lab						, Aug 2014 – Apr 2020
* Machined prototype and built the user interface and data collection software (LabVIEW) for a custom force-measurement system for standing balance experiments (U.S. patent)
* Established and validated a frequency-based filtering method (LabVIEW) to characterize foot force control while standing in healthy and stroke-affected people (journal manuscript)
### Advisor for Industry Collaborations								, Jan 2020 – Present
* Funding Acquisition: led the writing of the scientific methods for a Small Business Institutional Grant for a collaboration project with medical doctors, prosthetists, academic 		          
professors, and graduate students 
* Scientific Liaison: ensured effective communication among participants, scientists, engineers, and medical professionals: prosthetists and physical therapists
* Assistant Conference Chair: coordinated the Dynamic walking 2023 Conference with 130 participants in Madison, WI, from academia and industry in the field of robotics, biomechanics, and artificial intelligence
### Teaching Assistant: Introduction to Biomechanics and Introduction to Robotics		, Aug 2014 – May 2020	
* Led biomechanics lab sessions and office hours, and trained new teaching assistants
* Facilitated python-based ROS development and use of robotic arms and mobile mini-cars
