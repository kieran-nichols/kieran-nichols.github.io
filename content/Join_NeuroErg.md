Photo from my first day at my new job! I am now a Research Scientist for the NeuroErgonomics Lab within 
UW-Madison Dept. of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISyE). I will work with Dr. Ranjana Mehta and 
her team in the field of Human Factors and Ergonomics. </br>  
My research will focus on the evaluation of 
cognitive (fNIRS) and motor (biomechanics) performance using motion sensing (IMU), haptic cueing, and 
electrical stimulation (GVS/tDCS). I'm excited to collaborate with the team and apply my skills in 
biomechanics and robotics.
